# Physical python

A python package aimed at teaching students physics through having
them program using 3d simulation. A key goal is to provide clear error
messages for mistakes common among intro physics students. Physical is
inspired by the visual package, but aims to provide improved error
messages and assignment semantics.

To install, (after you have installed python) run:

    pip install --user physical

You may be able to omit the "--user" above if you are installing as
root, or are running Windows or MacOS.
